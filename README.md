# soda

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of soda is to allow you to programmatically access a wealth of
open data resources from governments, non-profits, and NGOs around the
world using the [Socrata Open Data API](https://dev.socrata.com) (SODA)
or [Discovery API](https://socratadiscovery.docs.apiary.io/).

There is another R package,
[RSocrata](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata), that supports basic
interactions with the SODA API; however, there has not been a commit to
the package in nearly two years. The soda package is intended to succeed
RSocrata, providing nicer outputs and more functionality.

This package is currently very early in development and I welcome
contributions, suggestions, and ideas.

<!--
## Installation

You can install the released version of soda from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("soda")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mccarthy-m-g/soda")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


```r
library(soda)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


```r
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:



In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
